# Salesforce-Contact-Lightning-App

The Lightning Contact Application is built on AURA Components which is considered as a markup language used for developing User Interfaces. The application is divided into three components to provide better functionality and user experience. Components, Controllers and Events are used in the application. Contact records are retrieved from the database with the help of Apex Classes and SOQL Queries.
